# Zombie-Simulator
Synopsis:

         A 'Zombie Outbreak' simulator created in Python 

Description:
          
         'Zombie-Simulator' features a 10 by 10 grid which represents a bustling city
         filled with humans. The program then runs an algorithm that predicts
         what would happen to the populace if a zombie outbreak were to occur. 
         
         The user can choose to run one of two parts featured in the program:
         
         Part A: 
            The user is able to pick how many turns they would like to run the algorithm for.
            An intial starting populace of humanity in the city is mapped out.
            In Turn 0, a zombie is spawned randomly in one of the grids in the city.
            The program then outputs the final outcome after an n number of turns have passed
            
         Part B:
            The user can choose to spawn an n number of zombies in a random location in the city.
            The program runs the algorithm and determines the number of turns it took for either
               humanity or the zombies to be completely wiped out.

Instructions:

         To use, simply run the run the program on PythonIDLE (as it has 
         a larger screen for text to show up) and follow the instructions.
